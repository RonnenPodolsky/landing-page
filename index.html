        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Real Madrid Club de Fútbol is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. The club was formed in 1902
          as Madrid Football Club, and played its first competitive match on 13 May 1902, when it lost 3–1 in the
          semi-final of the Campeonato de Copa de S.M. Alfonso XIII against FC Barcelona.[1] Real Madrid played against
          other local clubs in various regional tournaments, that served as qualifiers for the Copa del Rey, from 1902
          to 1940.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1929, the club became one of the founding members of La Liga, Spain's first national league. As of 2022,
          Real is one of only three clubs never to have been relegated from the top level of Spanish football, the
          others being Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona.

        <h2>Records</h2>
        <p>
          Raúl holds the record for most Real Madrid appearances, having played 741 first-team matches from 1994 to
          2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis, Jr., having played 710
          times.


        </p>

        <p>
          The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 170 caps (167 while at the
          club), Sergio Ramos is Real's most capped international player.
          Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–18) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[195][196] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–64), Santillana (1971–88), Ferenc Puskás (1958–66), Hugo Sánchez (1985–92), Karim Benzema (2009–current) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010).

        <h2>Ownership</h2>
        <p>
          It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming
          the world's richest professional football club.[280] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city
          of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr
          Vallehermoso and OHL.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as
          Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds
          for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[58] The European
          Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form
          of state subsidy.
